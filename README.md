# 100-vex
Code for VRC 2023-24 at BLHS

This will be updated with code as the season goes on and will serve as documentation and an engineering log.
With this project, I am going to be focusing on **modularity** and **readability**. I need to work on writing cleaner code, and that is what I plan to do.
